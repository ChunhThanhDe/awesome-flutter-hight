## Open Source Apps
- ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/roughike/inKino?style=social) [inKino](https://github.com/roughike/inKino): inKino is a multiplatform Dart app for browsing movies and showtimes for Finnkino cinemas.

  InKino showcases **Redux**, has an extensive set of automated tests and 40% code sharing between Flutter and web. The Android & iOS apps are made with a single Flutter codebase. The progressive web app is made with AngularDart. This project is generally something that I believe is a good example of a multiplatform Dart project.

My intention in creating this app was understanding the intricacies of building apps in Flutter. Just like the native Android App this app does **not make any efforts in being a nicely architectured application**. That being said the whole point is to showcase Flutter's capabilities for building simple apps and to understand key difference and advantages to native development.
